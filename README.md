# Portfolio challenge


## Description

This is a portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to clients or employers who need a front-end developer with a background in graphic design. With the exception of the first project featured which was done in the bootcamp, I created all the content at different periods in my learning journey prior to the bootcamp. As the bootcamp course progresses and more projects are deployed, I will have more to showcase my strongest works as well as the thought processes behind it. 

For now, I am applying the core skills I have recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.I get to practice my new skills while creating something that I might use during my job search. 


## Usage

This is made for web browsers on Desktops or laptops but is also responsive.
